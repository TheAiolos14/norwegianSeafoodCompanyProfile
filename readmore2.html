				<p>
					The harvesting of wild fish and shellfish is highly regulated, particularly in the United States and Canada.  
					These countries have the highest ecological standards for fisheries in the world.  
					Regulations have been implemented so that the populations of fish and shellfish can be replenished.  
					This helps fishermen maintain a livelihood and helps to protect species from extinction so that consumers can enjoy salmon, halibut, crab and shrimp for generations to come.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two of the most popular fish, salmon and halibut, are generally in season in the summertime.  
					The exact calendar varies by state, country and even body of water. The season closes on the earlier of the specified date or when the maximum tonnage has been harvested.  
					Your best bet for buying wild-caught, fresh seafood is to patronize and rely on a reputable fishmonger, such as Flying Fish Company in Portland.
				</p>

					There is an old saying that you should only eat oysters in months with an 'r' in their name (September, October, etc.).  
					This hails from the days when refrigeration was lacking or non-existent; unless oysters are kept very cold they quickly spoil.  
					The chilling process has made great strides and oysters can safely be consumed in any month, however, there is a flavor and texture difference between winter and summer oysters.  
					Oysters spawn in the warm summer months.  During this time their flesh becomes fatty, watery and less flavorful, so if possible, choose oysters that come from cool waters during the summer months.  
					(Note:  Most of the oysters (and clams and mussels) we consume are farmed.  
					Some farmers are using a genetic procedure that renders the oysters sterile so they never spawn, making prime oysters available year round.  
					Good for the consumers, not so good for the oysters.)
