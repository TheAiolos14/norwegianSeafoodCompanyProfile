					In this quick and easy recipe — adapted from The Splendid Table’s How To Eat Supper by Lynne Rossetto Kasper and Sally Swift  — jumbo shrimp are bathed in a brine flavored with salt, sugar and chili powder, and then sautéed with loads of fresh ginger and garlic. 
					It’s a delicious and flavorful shrimp dish that appeals to kids and adults alike. 
					In fact, the recipe headnote reads: “If there is one recipe in this book that is guaranteed to have your family moaning with gratitude, this is it. 
					After eating these shrimp, a five-year-old has been known to say, ‘Wow, Mom, thanks!’ And they’ve driven a grown woman to shamelessly lick her plate—in front of everyone.” 
					(Thanks to my friend, Kim Cohen, for sharing the recipe with me!)

					Before we get started, a few words on buying shrimp. Unless you live on the coast and have access to fresh shrimp, it’s best to buy frozen. 
					The “fresh” shrimp you see in the seafood case at the supermarket are almost always thawed frozen shrimp, and you never know how long they’ve been sitting there. 
					Most shrimp are cleaned and flash frozen shortly after being caught, so you’re better off buying frozen shrimp and defrosting them yourself.  
					For this recipe, try to find jumbo frozen shrimp (21-25 to a pound) labeled “shell split and deveined.” 
					Come dinnertime, all you have to do is run the shrimp under warm water to quickly defrost and then peel.
				</p>

					Note: After making this recipe as it was originally printed, I made some minor modifications without any noticeable change in flavor. 
					I increased the amount of shrimp from 1-1/2 pounds to 2 pounds (since frozen shrimp are usually sold by the pound) and reduced the brine by half 
					(the recipe made a ton, and it was unnecessary).
